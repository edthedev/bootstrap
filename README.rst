Bootstrap a Workstation
==============================
In accordance with the Three_Vices_, a programmer may be *proud* of their workstation configuration, *impatient* to have it set up on any new workstation, and much too *lazy* to do spend any time setting it up.

To fetch the script on any Linux workstation.::

	wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/edthedev/bootstrap/master/bootstrap.sh

To fetch the script on an Apple computer::

    curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/edthedev/bootstrap/master/bootstrap.sh > bootstrap.sh

Run the script to get a copy of the other scripts.::

	chmod +x bootstrap.sh
	./bootstrap.sh

You should now have a directory called 'bootstrap', with all of the other scripts installed. Have a look, and run whichever you need.
